# Image Encryption App

This project is a simple image encryption application built with Node.js, Express, and Multer. The application allows users to upload an image, which is then encrypted using AES-256-CBC encryption, and also decrypt previously encrypted images.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images to be encrypted.
- **Encryption**: The app encrypts the uploaded images using AES-256-CBC algorithm.
- **Decryption**: Users can decrypt the encrypted images using the provided encryption key.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-encryption-app.git
    cd image-encryption-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

2. **Upload an Image for Encryption**
    - Endpoint: `POST /upload`
    - Form Data: `image` (type: file)
    - Response: The encrypted image is saved on the server, and a secure key is provided in the response.

3. **Decrypt an Image**
    - Endpoint: `POST /decrypt`
    - Form Data: 
      - `encryptedImage` (type: file)
      - `key` (type: text, the encryption key provided during encryption)
    - Response: The decrypted image is sent back in the response.

## Dependencies

- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) - Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files.
- [crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) - Provides cryptographic functionality that includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, and verify functions.
- [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) - Provides an API for interacting with the file system in a manner closely modeled around standard POSIX functions.

## File Structure

- `server.js`: The main server file that handles the routes for image upload, encryption, and decryption.
- `package.json`: Contains metadata about the project and lists the dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: Describes the exact tree that was generated by installing dependencies.
